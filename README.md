# Grabbing My Random Thoughts

Trying to create a simple data dictionary tool. I'm guessing something like this.

A backend of Neo4j. A flask frontend.

Hold off on search for right now.


## Plan to go forward.
Set up the project. Docker, Make, Docker Compose for ease of development. Pipfile. Ect.

Then start with databases. Run show databases and write that to a file.

Then write that file to neo4j.
